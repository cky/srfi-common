  <title>Scheme Request for Implementation - FAQ</title>
  <link href="admin.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

<h1>Scheme Request for Implementation - FAQ</h1>The ``Scheme
Request for Implementation'' process is <a href=
"srfi-process.html">documented elsewhere</a>. This document is
intended to provide some of the rationale about SRFIs rather than
cluttering up that document.

  <p>The SRFI process grew out of the Scheme Workshop held in
  Baltimore, MD, on September 26, 1998, where the attendees
  considered a number of proposals for standardized feature sets
  for inclusion in Scheme implementations. Many of the proposals
  received overwhelming support in a series of straw votes. Along
  with this there was concern that the next Revised Report would
  not be produced for several years and this would prevent the
  timely implementation of standardized approaches to several
  important problems and needs in the Scheme community.

  <p>The SRFI process is a service being provided to the Scheme
  community by the editors, currently <a href=

  Languages and Compilers</a> group at the University of TÃ¼bingen.

  <dl>
    <dt>Are SRFIs standards?

    <dd>
      Yes and no. SRFIs are <strong>not</strong> official
      standards. There exist organizations such as ISO, IEEE, ANSI,
      etc. who are set up to develop official standards. The SRFI
      process is designed as an attempt to maximize the quality of
      SRFIs within the constraint of not assigning authority to
      anyone.

      <p>There are official Scheme standards, ANSI-???? and
      IEEE-???. SRFIs are in addition to these standards.

      <p>On the other hand, the process for creating SRFIs
      <strong>is</strong> standardized, and each final SRFI remains
      frozen and publicly available, hence they have many of the
      properties of standards. So you might choose to think of them
      as unofficial standards.

    <dt>Are SRFIs replacements for RnRS?

    <dd>
      No. The editors of the SRFIs do not currently include any of
      the editors of any of the Revised Reports.

      <p>Each Revised Report has been written by a different body,
      which determines what eventually is and is not included in
      that report. The SRFI process is orthogonal to all of these
      reports. Authors of SRFIs must not expect that their SRFIs
      will be included, or even be considered, by the authors of
      reports.

      <p>Of course anyone, including authors of future Revised
      Reports, is welcome to employ the definition and rationale of
      a SRFI, the discussion surrounding its adoption, and its
      widespread implementation to argue that the authors of a
      standard or report should consider adding the contents of the
      SRFI to that standard.

      <p>If SRFIs had existed before R4RS, the macro appendix to
      that report might have made more sense to have been released
      as a SRFI. But it didn't. So it wasn't.

      <p>There is <strong>considerable</strong> value in reading
      the <a href=
      "http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/rrrs-archive.html">
      discussions of the RnRS authors</a>, as they have often
      considered issues that are candidates for SRFIs.

    <dt><a name="preliminary">Are SRFIs a discussion forum for
    preliminary ideas?</a>

    <dd>No. SRFIs stands for ``Scheme Request for Implementation''.
    Note the last word. If someone has amorphous ideas for
    something that would be cool, but has no idea how it might be
    done, they should discuss it in journals, workshops, seminars
    or <a href="news:comp.lang.scheme">news groups</a>. When the
    discussions have coalesced to the point where an implementation
    strategy is apparent, then it is time to write up a SRFI
    proposal.

    <dt>I really think that there should be a place to archive
    non-implementation documents.

    <dd>You're not alone! There seem to be lots of people who
    disagree with the editors on this point. We will almost
    certainly address this need in the not too distant future -
    possibly within the SRFI process, or more likely with a
    separate process. If you have ideas on how this should be done,
    please send mail to <a href=
    "mailto:srfi-editors%20at%20srfi%20dot%20schemers%20dot%20org">&lt;srfi
    minus editors at srfi dot schemers dot org&gt;</a>

    <dt>Are SRFIs ``RFCs for the Scheme community''?

    <dd>Not quite. As RFC1796 (<a href=
    "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1796.txt">Not All RFCs are
    Standards</a>) says, RFCs serve a variety of purposes. The SRFI
    editors feel that there are sufficient other venues for
    discussion of ideas. The point of SRFIs is that a programmer
    can dependably test to see what features a Scheme
    implementation provides, and can therefore program in a
    portable way beyond the bounds of standardized Scheme.

    <dt>What's with all the time periods? Why so little
    time?

    <dd>
      The time periods are an attempt to drive the SRFI process as
      quickly as possible while maintaining sufficient time for
      sober second thought. To maximize the quality of SRFIs, we
      want all of the relevant people to be involved in the
      discussion of any particular SRFI proposal. Many of those
      people are very busy, and this mechanism constrains the time
      commitment they must make to stay on top of a proposal. It
      also prevents discussion on a proposal from dragging on in an
      endless repetition of the same points, long after anyone's
      opinion is likely to be changed.

      <p>The other issue in the timing is to prevent editors from
      stone-walling a proposal. It is not their job to make
      qualitative judgments about proposals, but rather to maintain
      the quality while expediting the creation of important
      unofficial standards.

      <p>If a proposal is still under discussion after 90 days, it
      means that it has been extended several times. The editors
      will normally extend the discussion period to maintain a
      minimum of 15 days after any significant change. Any proposal
      still under active discussion and revision after 90 days is
      not ready for codification. It will then be withdrawn for a
      (normal) minimum of 30 days after which it may be
      resubmitted. If it is now in good shape, it will likely
      become final after the 60 day discussion period. Thus, it
      will have been delayed a maximum of 90 days. This is likely
      to happen only in very exceptional cases, and is the only
      cost of the fixed time periods.

    <dt><a name="teeth">What kind of standards are these,
    anyway? There aren't any teeth in the rules!</a>

    <dd>To have enforcement, there must be authority. There is no
    absolute authority in the Scheme community, so there can be no
    absolute enforcement. The final authority is the implementors.
    If they believe that a particular SRFI documents a useful or
    important feature, they will add it to their implementations;
    if not, they won't. The discussion relating to any SRFI will be
    retained indefinitely, and implementors can refer to that when
    making their decision. Hence poorly worded, reasoned, or
    defended SRFIs will be nothing more than a waste of some time -
    regrettable, but necessary to retain an open process.

    <dt>Why do I have to include a reference
    implementation?

    <dd>See the discussion above about <a href=
    "#preliminary">preliminary ideas</a>. SRFIs are about
    implementation. If you haven't either: (a) built one, or (b)
    have a very clear outline of how to build one, then you aren't
    documenting anything useful about implementation. As the
    process document says: if you think the editors are wrong to
    withdraw your proposal because it doesn't have a sufficient
    outline of implementation, then prove us wrong by going and
    implementing it on some system. Then your SRFI will return to
    draft, and eventually active status.

    <dt>Do SRFIs exist to describe the features of a particular
    Scheme implementation?

    <dd>
      No. Every SRFI should describe a cohesive feature set that is
      portable across a variety of Scheme implementations. (Here we
      mean portable in the sense of being possible to implement,
      not in the sense of a portable implementation.) Rather than
      testing to see if the implementation is, e.g. Guile-4.3c, a
      program should test for the particular features that it
      requires.

      <p>This is a lesson learned from the Emacs world where it
      used to be that code would check to see what version of Emacs
      it was running on and make assumptions about the features
      that that particular version provided. Unfortunately that
      made the code un-portable to alternative Emacs
      implementations that had the required features but different
      series of version numbers. The same lesson can be observed in
      old C code that assumed that such-and-such a system had
      particular features. More commonly today, C programs use a
      configuration program that determines what libraries and
      functions are available, regardless of the system or
      compiler. The mechanism documented in <a href="srfi-7/">SRFI
      7</a> essentially provides a similar capability, while
      staying within Scheme code.

      <p>The biggest advantage of checking for features rather than
      implementations is that code becomes portable to systems of
      which the author was unaware, if they provide the features
      that the program requires.

    <dt>The process document mentions that different SRFIs may
    conflict with each other. Won't that make it impossible for an
    implementation to support conflicting SRFIs?

    <dd>Not necessarily. See <a href="/srfi-7/">SRFI 7</a>.
    <a name="copyright"></a>

    <dt>Does the SRFI copyright permit using a SRFI sample
    implementation (or a derivative of one) in my Scheme
    implementation?

    <dd>Yes.

    <dt>Does the SRFI copyright permit using parts of a SRFI in
    the documentation of my Scheme implementation?

    <dd>Yes.

    <dt>Where did the acronym come from? It's a mouthful

    <dd>Alan Bawden suggested RFI at the Scheme workshop as a
    humorous reference to RFCs. The S was added because the initial
    editors (and others) felt that ``Scheme'' should be in there
    somewhere. If you pronounce it ``ess-are-eff-eye'' it certainly
    is a mouthful, but if you pronounce it ``surfie'', as we do,
    it's fine. Scheme Implementation Request (SIR) was also
    proposed.

    <dt>Are there any special considerations if I use Github to
    propose or comment on a SRFI?

    <dd>Please keep the discussion of each SRFI on its mailing
    list. For example, if you create a pull request, send all your
    comments to the mailing list. While Github's tools can be
    convenient, we don't want to lose any of our history to Github.
    While their APIs make it straightforward to download almost
    everything (e.g. comments, issues, and pull requests), we don't
    have code in place to do that automatically.

    <dt>What if I don't want to use Github?

    <dd>If you'd rather not use Github to propose SRFIs or
    revisions to them, feel free to point the editors at alternate
    Git repos or to send us patch files. (Patch files can be
    created using <code>git format-patch -M origin/master</code> or
    <code>git send-email</code>.) If you're a SRFI author and
    would rather not use Git, either, just send updated files (or
    links to them) and we'll check in the changes.
